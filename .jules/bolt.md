## 2025-05-22 - [Standard Performance Patterns for Agentic Pipelines]
**Learning:** In agentic pipelines like Raadbot, repetitive tasks like prompt template loading and output validation against schemas are significant bottlenecks when scaled across many candidates. I/O-bound tasks (disk reads/writes) are the most critical to optimize. Pre-compiling JSON validators and caching prompt templates in memory (using `lru_cache`) drastically reduces the overhead. Consolidating state-file writes is also crucial to avoid exponential slowdown as the state grows.
**Action:** Always pre-compile `jsonschema` validators and cache prompt templates at the module level or using `lru_cache`. Ensure that state-persistence methods have options to skip redundant writes when called within a composite operation.
