## 2025-05-14 - Initial UX Audit of Dashboard
**Learning:** Found several accessibility gaps in the dashboard, including missing ARIA labels on interactive elements and decorative elements not being hidden from screen readers. Also identified a lack of quick-copy functionality for the System Prompt, which is a common user need when refining prompts.
**Action:** Implement ARIA labels, hide decorative icons, and add a "Copy to Clipboard" feature with visual feedback.
